# README for Digits Classification Using SVM and Ensemble Methods

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to classify images using the `sklearn` library in Python. The dataset utilized is the popular Digits dataset, which is a collection of vectorized images of handwritten digits. Each image is labeled with the correct digit, making this a supervised learning classification problem.

## Overview

The project showcases two primary approaches:
1. **Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classification**: Utilizes SVM with different kernels ('linear', 'rbf', 'poly') to classify the digits.
2. **Ensemble Methods**: Explores classification using ensemble methods like RandomForestClassifier, AdaBoostClassifier, and BaggingClassifier, though these are mentioned and not fully implemented in the provided code.

## Dependencies
- Python 3
- `scikit-learn` (for machine learning models and utilities)
- `numpy` (for numerical computations)
- `matplotlib` (for visualization)
- `pandas` (for data manipulation)

## Dataset
The Digits dataset from `sklearn.datasets` is used. Each sample in the dataset is a vectorized 8x8 image of a digit (0-9). The dataset is split into features (`X`) and target labels (`y`), with `X` being scaled for normalization.

## Key Steps
1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: The Digits dataset is loaded and preprocessed. The features are scaled using `scale` for normalization.
2. **Data Exploration**: Basic exploration to understand the dataset's balance and uniqueness of labels.
3. **Model Training and Evaluation**:
    - **SVM Classification**: Different configurations of SVM are explored using `GridSearchCV` for hyperparameter tuning. The best parameters and model performance are outputted.
    - **Ensemble Methods**: Mentioned but not fully implemented in the provided codes.
4. **Results Analysis**: The performance of the best SVM model is evaluated on a test set, and a confusion matrix is generated to understand the model's classification accuracy across different digits.

## Usage
To run the project, ensure that all dependencies are installed and execute the Python script. The script performs the following actions in sequence:
- Loads and preprocesses the data.
- Splits the data into training and testing sets.
- Applies SVM with hyperparameter tuning using `GridSearchCV`.
- Trains the best SVM model found and evaluates it on the test set.
- Outputs the best hyperparameters, model performance metrics, and a confusion matrix.

## Conclusion
This project highlights the effectiveness of SVM for digit classification on the Digits dataset. Through hyperparameter tuning, the optimal SVM configuration is identified, demonstrating the potential of machine learning techniques in recognizing patterns in image data.
